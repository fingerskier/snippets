Calculate density via differential hydrostatic pressure:

density(t) = (diffPressure + a(t0 - t)) / (weight * distance * (1 + b(t - tmed)))
- a ~ filling fluid compensation coefficient
- t0 ~ calibration temperature
- t ~ process temperature
- distance ~ between the 
- b ~ metal dilation coefficient
- tmed ~ temperature downstream of sensor
